them in Bayesian impact evaluation, which is particularly helpful to learn more from expensive new programs tested on relatively small samples."""

TITLE_QUESTION_1 = '2.	Impact on the Number of Different Products Exported in the Year After the Intervention Begins'

SUBTITLE_QUESTION_1 = '''Products are measured using the 6-digit product classification in the harmonized system for the Andean Community. \\
    Examples of products being exported by these firms include different tropical fruits (e.g. uchuva (cape gooseberry), granadilla (yellow passionfruit), gulupa (purple passionfruit), pitaya (dragonfruit), and tomate de arbol (tamarillo)), cotton t-shirts, long and short trousers for women and children, shirts and blouses of artificial or synthetic fiber, miscellaneous plastic products, and miscellaneous steel products. \\
          In 2017, on average the 100 firms offered the full intervention exported 3.4 different products. This is the average over both exporters and non-exporters, so includes zeros for the half of the firms that do not export. \\
_We want to know how much you think this will CHANGE for the group getting offered the full intervention compared to getting offered just the diagnostic and trade fair, over the first 12 months since firms start their implementation. \\
For example, if you think there is a 40 percent chance the intervention will increase the average number of products firms export by 3.3 to 3.7 products,double click on the cell of the column Percentage corresponding to 3.3 to 3.7 and write 40, and allocate your remaining 60 percent according to what else you think is likely._

SUBTITLE_QUESTION_1_2 = '''
What would be the minimum effect size you would want to see in order to consider scaling up this program to more firms? \\
(Express your answer in terms of number of additional products, e.g. if you would want the 3.4  product average to increase to at least 4.4, you should give 1 as your answer).'''
